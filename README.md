This repository contains a number of Java tutorials focusing on Data Structures and tools around them. To accomplish this, a Java kernel is used in Jupyter. If you don't want, or don't know how to download a Java kernel for Jupyter, you can use this Binder launcher 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/irmaR/java_tutorials/master) that will download everything for you automatically.

In case you still want to have a Java kernel yourself for your own Jupyter notebook use this github repository and follow the installation instructions to accomplish that: https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava It's pretty cool.

Enjoy!
