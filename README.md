This repository contains a number of tutorials on Java focusing on Data Structures. To accomplish this a java kernel is used. If you don't want, or don't know how to download a Java kernel for jupyter, you can use a Binder launcher that will download everything for you automatically.

In case you still want to have a Java kernel yourself for your own Jupyter notebook use this github repository and follow the installation instructions to accomplish that: https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava It's pretty cool.

Enjoy!
